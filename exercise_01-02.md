Prints `2`, as there are no floats in the expression, so no conversion is performed:

    cout << "Seven divided by three is " << 7 / 3 << endl;

Print `2.3...`, as there is a float in the expression:

    cout << "Seven divided by three is " << 7.0 / 3 << endl;
    cout << "Seven divided by three is " << 7.0 / 3.0 << endl;
